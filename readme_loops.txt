/**********************************************************************
 *  How does the mean squared distance of a random walker grow

 *  answer based on computational experiments.
 *********************************************************************/

 The mean squared distance will be roughly the same as the number of steps N.
    
If I take 100 steps, my mean squared distance is 101.446 (or something around
there depending on the trial.) If I take 200, I get 195.75. If I take 800,
I get 811.8264. If I take 1600, I get 1600.13064. 
    
I do not understand this. I asked Ankur in office hours about it, and he 
didn't explain it to me, telling me instead that that's just the way it
is. I'm so curious, though. Why does it grow direct-linearly with N?

Yesterday, Ibs helped me to find and fix logical errors in GCD and RGBtoHSV.
    
Today Ankur helped me fix RandomWalkers when I was missing the part that 
reset the walk to (0,0).

I'm still not sure I fundamentally understand the GCD program. I'd say that
was definitely the hardest for me, as I really thought it was going to need
to be much more complicated. Ibs recommended I make it simpler and helped me
figure out to do so, and when I tried it it just kind of worked. It makes
me uncomfortable that it doesn't make total sense to me.

I just want to thank you for having the best office hours schedule ever. Being
able to go at basically any time and nearly immediately get help is exactly
what's needed in this course. You're the best.
